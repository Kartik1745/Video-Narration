# Video-Narration with AI

Welcome to the Video Narration with AI project! üåçü§ñ

This repository showcases a project where we leverage the power of computer vision, natural language processing, and text-to-speech synthesis to enhance videos with AI-generated narration.

# Project Overview

### Video to Frames Conversion:
Utilize OpenCV to convert a video into frames at specified intervals for efficient processing.

### AI-Generated Voiceover Script:
Employ OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision model to analyze visual content within each frame.
Dynamically generate a voiceover script in the style of David Attenborough, capturing the essence of scenes.

### Audio Synthesis:
Use OpenAI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) model to convert generated scripts into captivating narrations.
Seamlessly integrate synthesized audio with the original video.

### Dynamic Audio Playback:
Utilize Pygame for dynamic playback of the AI-generated narration, providing a real-time preview of the enhanced audio.

### Final Video Production:
Combine enhanced audio with the original video using MoviePy, resulting in a final output that seamlessly blends visually stunning footage with engaging AI-generated narration.
